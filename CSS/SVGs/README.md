# SVG Graphics & Animation Library

A comprehensive collection of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) examples demonstrating native browser drawing capabilities, complex pathing, and CSS/SMIL animations.

## 🚀 Features
* **Basic Geometric Shapes:** Implementation of native SVG elements like `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, and `<polygon>`.
* **Complex Pathing:** Custom-drawn shapes including Bézier curves (`Q` and `C` commands) used to create organic shapes and icons.
* **Native SMIL Animations:** * **Motion:** Moving elements across coordinates.
    * **Color Morphing:** Smoothly transitioning fills between different HEX/RGB values.
    * **Transformation:** Pulsing and scaling effects.
    * **Stroke Animation:** "Drawing" lines in real-time using `stroke-dasharray`.
* **Advanced Gradients:** Implementation of both Linear and Radial gradients with animated color stops.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **HTML5 SVG API:** For high-quality, resolution-independent graphics.
* **SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language):** For high-performance animations handled by the browser's rendering engine.

## 📁 File Structure
* `index.html` - Contains all SVG coordinate data and animation logic.

## ⚙️ Setup
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the animated library. Since SVGs are vector-based, you can zoom in indefinitely without losing any image quality!
