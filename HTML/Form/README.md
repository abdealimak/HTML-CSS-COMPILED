# Local Storage Registration Form

A functional, responsive registration form that uses browser Local Storage to save and persist user data without a backend database.

* **Instant Feedback:** Displays the saved registration details dynamically on the screen upon submission.
* **Data Management:** Includes a "Clear Saved Data" feature to reset the storage and UI.
* **Modern Design:** Features a purple-to-blue linear gradient background and a clean "card-style" form layout.
* **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for mobile devices with stackable radio buttons and adjusted padding for smaller screens.
